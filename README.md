# DiscordBotJS
A second try at a discord bot, this time using Node.JS with the Discord node. This is my first time using Javascript.
Other than normal hardcoded commands, This bot is able to play music using urls and youtube searches, as well as create simple custom commands through the discord chat, so that all users with the permission can easily add their commands.
